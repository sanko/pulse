# The infix Signature and Type System

### Part 1: Introduction

#### 1.1 The Challenge of Interoperability

The core challenge of any Foreign Function Interface (FFI) is establishing a precise, unambiguous contract between the caller and the callee. Both sides must agree on the exact size, alignment, and representation of every piece of data to avoid memory corruption and undefined behavior.

#### 1.2 The Limitations of C Declarations

C's declaration syntax, while powerful, is notoriously difficult for both humans and machines to parse. It often hides the true memory layout of data, and complex declarations can be nearly indecipherable. A declaration like `void (*(*f[])())()` is a testament to this complexity.

#### 1.3 Our Solution: A Human-First Signature System

`infix` solves this with a string-based representation of C types and function signatures, built on three core principles:

1.  **Human-Readability First:** The syntax is intuitive, avoids cryptic abbreviations, and prioritizes clarity.
2.  **Unambiguous and Consistent:** The grammar is designed to be parsed linearly without ambiguity, using clear delimiters (`{}`, `[]`, `<>`) for composite types.
3.  **Developer-Centric Type System:** The language provides two tiers of primitive types: abstract C-style keywords (like `int`, `long`) for general use, and explicit fixed-width keywords (like `int32`, `uint64`) for precise layout control and maximum portability.

## Part 2: The Signature Language Reference

The signature language allows you to describe any C type as a string. All whitespace and C++-style line comments (`# ...`) are ignored, allowing you to format complex signatures for readability.

### 2.1 Primitives

#### 2.4 Bitfields and Flexible Arrays

*   **Bitfields:** Bitfields are defined by appending a colon and a bit-width to a struct member's type. They are only valid within `struct` definitions.
    *   **Syntax:** `name : type : width`
    *   **Example:** `!{ flags : uint16 : 3, mode : uint16 : 5 }`
    *   **Zero-width:** `pad : uint32 : 0` forces alignment to the next boundary of the type.

*   **Flexible Array Members (FAM):** A Flexible Array Member must be the *last* member of a struct. It is represented as an array with no size.
    *   **Syntax:** `name : [ ? : type ]` (Note the size before the colon is represented with a question mark (`?`)).
    *   **Example:** `{ len : int, data : [ ? : char ] }`

### 2.5 Scope and Namespaces

`infix` supports C++-style namespaces and nested scopes using the `::` operator. This is used in the Type Registry to define types that live within a namespace, and it is recognized by the C++ mangling dialects to generate correct ABI-compliant symbols.

*   **Example:** `@Graphics::Math::Vector3`

### 2.6 Built-in Aliases vs. Registry Aliases

While most custom names in `infix` require a Registry (`@Name`), certain built-in aliases are handled natively by the parser to preserve their semantic meaning for FFI marshallers.

*   **Registry Aliases (`@MyType`):** Require an `infix_registry_t`. These are deep-copied and resolved during the resolution stage.
*   **Built-in Aliases (`wchar_t`, `size_t`, etc.):** These resolve directly to `PRIMITIVE` types but **retain their name**.

#### Why this matters for Strings

In C, a `wchar_t[]` and an `int32_t[]` might look identical in memory on Linux (both are arrays of 4-byte integers). However, by using the keyword `wchar_t`, `infix` preserves that name in the metadata. High-level languages (like Perl or Python) can use `infix_type_get_name()` to see the string "wchar_t" and automatically treat the buffer as a string instead of a list of numbers.

## Part 3: The Named Type Registry

The registry is the key to managing complexity in large FFI projects. It provides a central, reusable, and readable way to define and use structs, unions, and type aliases.

### Defining Types (`infix_register_types`)

You populate a registry by passing a string of semicolon-separated definitions. The parser is robust and handles forward declarations and out-of-order definitions automatically.

**Syntax:** `@TypeName = <TypeDefinition>;`

```c
infix_registry_t* registry = infix_registry_create();

const char* my_types =
    // Create readable aliases for any type.
    "@UserID = uint64;"
    "@CallbackFunc = (int)->void;"
    "@Handle = *void;"

    // Define a struct using an alias.
    "@User = { id: @UserID, name: *char };"

    // Define a recursive linked-list node.
    "@Node = { value: int, next: *@Node };"

    // Define mutually recursive types using forward declarations.
    "@A;"
    "@B;"
    "@A = { b_ptr: *@B };"
    "@B = { a_ptr: *@A };"
;

infix_status status = infix_register_types(registry, my_types);
```

**Rule:** Redefining a type that already exists in a registry is an error. Once a name is defined, it is immutable for the lifetime of the registry.

### Using Named Types

Once registered, you can use named types in any signature string by passing the registry handle to the FFI creation function. This works for simple aliases as well as complex structs.

```c
// Using the registry from the example above:
const char* signature = "(*@User, @CallbackFunc) -> void";

infix_forward_t* trampoline = NULL;
infix_forward_create(&trampoline, signature, my_func, registry);
```

When you inspect a type created from an alias (e.g., `@UserID`), you can retrieve its semantic name using `infix_type_get_name()` while still accessing its underlying structural properties (size, alignment, category).

## Part 4: Technical Specification

#### 4.1 Whitespace and Comments
Insignificant whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) is permitted between any two tokens and should be ignored. Comments begin with a hash symbol (`#`) and continue to the end of the line.

#### 4.2 EBNF Grammar

This Extended Backus-Naur Form grammar formally defines the signature format.

```ebnf

pointer_type        ::= '*' value_type
array_type          ::= '[' Integer ':' value_type ']'
grouped_type        ::= '(' value_type ')'

aggregate_type      ::= struct_type | union_type | packed_struct_type
struct_type         ::= '{' member_list? '}'
packed_struct_type  ::= '!' ( Integer ':' )? '{' member_list? '}'
union_type          ::= '<' member_list? '>'
member_list         ::= member ( ',' member )*
member              ::= ( Identifier ':' )? value_type

#### 4.3 Design Rationale: Why This Syntax?

1.  **Readability over Brevity:** The two-tier type system (`int` vs. `int32`) directly maps to developer intent ("portability" vs. "specific layout").
2.  **Unambiguous Grammar:** Using a pure prefix for pointers (`*`) and clear delimiters for all other composites (`[]`, `{}`, `<>`) eliminates ambiguity and allows for simple, linear parsing.
3.  **Consistency:** The `c[...]` and `v[...]` syntax for complex and vector types creates a consistent "family" of specialized numeric constructors.

#### 4.4 Comparison with Other Systems

*   **vs. Itanium C++ ABI:** Itanium is a "write-only" format designed for linkers. `infix` signatures are designed for humans to read and write. The library includes built-in "dialects" to transform these human-readable strings into standard C++ mangled symbols. This allows developers to resolve C++ functions dynamically without manually calculating complex mangled names.
*   **vs. Python's `ctypes`:** `ctypes` uses a programmatic, object-oriented approach. The `infix` format is a standalone, declarative string that can be used by *any* language.
*   **vs. `dyncall`'s Signature Format:** `dyncall`'s format is a flat string of single characters (e.g., `isL)d`), prioritizing brevity. `infix` prioritizes human readability (`(int, ushort, longlong) -> double`). Further, `dyncall` handles aggregate types programmatically via a separate `DCaggr` API, whereas `infix` treats complex data structures as first-class citizens *within the signature string itself*, making the call site much more declarative.
