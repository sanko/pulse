# Project Roadmap: infix FFI

This document outlines the planned development goals for the infix FFI library, categorized by priority. Each item includes the context for why it's important, the proposed idea, a clear definition of what "done" looks like, and potential challenges.

## High Priority: Foundation & Stability

*These tasks focus on critical infrastructure, core reliability, and essential C language feature completeness. They must be addressed before major new features are added.*

- [x] **Design and Implement New Signature Parser (`signature.c`)**
    *   **Context:** The current single-character signature system is minimal and lacks the expressiveness needed for rich introspection and clarity. The v1.0 specification is the path forward.
    *   **Idea:** Replace the existing recursive-descent parser in `signature.c` with a new one that implements the full v1.0 EBNF grammar. This will be a ground-up rewrite.
    *   **Goal:** The new `infix_signature_parse` can correctly parse all valid examples from the v1.0 specification, including nested structs, unions, and pointers. It must produce a valid `infix_type` graph in an arena. The old parser will be completely removed.
    *   **Possible Roadblocks:** This is the largest single task. It requires careful implementation to handle all grammatical rules, whitespace, and error conditions correctly.

- [x] **Update Type System for New Concepts (`types.c`, `infix.h`)**
    *   **Context:** The v1.0 spec introduces concepts like `enum` that are not present in the current type system.
    *   **Idea:**
        1.  Add a new `INFIX_TYPE_ENUM` category to the `infix_type_category` enum.
        2.  Add a corresponding `enum_info` struct to the `infix_type_t` `meta` union to store the underlying integer type.
        3.  Implement a new `infix_type_create_enum(arena, &type, underlying_type)` function.
    *   **Goal:** The type system can fully represent every construct from the v1.0 signature language. The new parser will use these new functions to build the type graph.

- [x] **Refactor and Test All Examples and Unit Tests**
    *   **Context:** Every single test file (`t/*.c`) and example file (`eg/**/*.c`) in the project uses the old signature format. They will all be broken by the new parser.
    *   **Idea:** Go through every `.c` file in the `t/` and `eg/` directories and update all signature strings to the new v1.o format.
    *   **Goal:** The entire test suite (`xmake test`) and all examples compile and run successfully using the new parser. This is the definition of "done" for the transition.
    *   **Possible Roadblocks:** This is a tedious but essential task. It will touch dozens of files and is a good opportunity to improve the clarity of existing tests.

- [x] **Update All Public Documentation (`README.md`, `cookbook.md`, etc.)**
    *   **Context:** The project's documentation is a key feature. It must be updated to reflect the new, more powerful signature language.
    *   **Idea:** Replace the existing `signatures.md` with the new v1.0 specification. Update the `README.md`, `cookbook.md`, and all other documentation to use and explain the new syntax.
    *   **Goal:** All documentation is consistent and accurately describes the v1.0 signature language. All code examples are updated to the new syntax.

- [x] **Re-evaluate and Implement Variadic API**
    *   **Context:** The new spec proposes a different model for handling variadic functions. The current implementation uses a single signature with a `;` separator.
    *   **Idea:** Remove the `num_fixed_args` parameter from the core `infix_forward_create_manual` and `infix_reverse_create_manual` functions. Implement the new high-level API proposed in the spec, `infix_forward_create_variadic`, which will internally construct the final, concrete signature before calling the manual API.
    *   **Goal:** The library's public API for variadics matches the new specification. The old semicolon logic is completely removed from the parser.

- [x] **Refactor Platform-Specific Emitters**
    *   **Context:** The initial design mixed platform-specific instruction emitters (e.g., for x86-64) into the generic `trampoline.c` and public `infix.h`, breaking the library's architectural abstraction.
    *   **Idea:** Move all platform-specific emitter functions into their own dedicated, internal modules (e.g., `abi_x64_emitters.c`, `abi_arm64_emitters.c`) with non-public headers.
    *   **Goal:** The generic `trampoline.c` is now 100% platform-agnostic. The public `infix.h` no longer exposes any internal emitter functions. The architecture is cleaner, more maintainable, and easier to extend to new platforms.

- [x] **Implement Fuzzing**
    *   **Context:** The type creation API is a potential attack surface for security vulnerabilities via malformed input. Fuzzing is the most effective method for automatically discovering such bugs.
    *   **Idea:** Create a fuzzing harness using a framework like libFuzzer that calls the type creation APIs with random, malformed data.
    *   **Goal:** An `xmake fuzz` target is created. The CI pipeline runs the fuzzer for a set duration to continuously search for vulnerabilities. The fuzzer runs without finding any crashes.
    *   **Possible Roadblocks:** Fuzzing can be slow; requires careful tuning of the CI process to avoid excessive run times. Setting up the fuzzing environment can be complex.

- [x] **Add Memory Stress Test with Valgrind Monitoring**
    *   **Context:** In a C library that performs many dynamic allocations, it's easy to introduce subtle memory leaks.
    *   **Idea:** Create a new test that rapidly creates and destroys thousands of trampolines with varied signatures in a tight loop.
    *   **Goal:** A new test target, `xmake run memory_test`, is created. The CI pipeline runs this test under Valgrind's `memcheck` tool on the Linux runner with `--leak-check=full`. The build must fail if Valgrind reports *any* memory leaks.
    *   **Possible Roadblocks:** Test can be slow to run; requires a Linux-based CI runner with Valgrind installed.

- [x] **Add Threading Stress Test**
    *   **Context:** The documentation claims callbacks are thread-safe. This must be rigorously proven to detect potential race conditions.
    *   **Idea:** Create a test that spawns multiple threads to call a single reverse trampoline concurrently.
    *   **Goal:** The project is compiled with a thread sanitizer (`-fsanitize=thread` for GCC/Clang) in the CI, and the stress test must pass without any reported data races.
    *   **Possible Roadblocks:** Threading bugs can be notoriously difficult to reproduce reliably; requires a sanitizer-compatible toolchain.

- [x] **Use Guard Pages for Freed Trampolines**
    *   **Context:** After a trampoline is freed, its function pointer becomes a dangling pointer. If a user accidentally calls it, a use-after-free vulnerability can be triggered.
    *   **Idea:** Instead of just releasing memory, change its protection to `PROT_NONE` (no read/write/execute). This turns a subtle vulnerability into a safe, immediate, and obvious crash.
    *   **Goal:** The `infix_executable_free` function is updated to use `mprotect`/`VirtualProtect`. A new test is created that frees a trampoline and then calls its old function pointer, asserting that the program safely terminates.
    *   **Possible Roadblocks:** Testing for an expected crash is non-trivial and may require platform-specific signal handling or process management in the test suite.

- [x] **Add `longdouble` Support**
    *   **Context:** `longdouble` was the last major C primitive type not supported by the library.
    *   **Idea:** Add a new primitive type and implement the correct, platform-specific ABI handling for it.
    *   **Goal:** `longdouble` is a recognized `infix_type` and passes correctly in forward and reverse calls on all supported platforms (System V, Windows/GCC, AArch64).

- [x] **Read-Only Callback Contexts (RELRO for Callbacks)**
    *   **Context:** The `infix_reverse_t` struct contains function pointers that could be targeted by memory corruption attacks to hijack control flow.
    *   **Idea:** After a callback context is created, use `mprotect`/`VirtualProtect` on the memory page containing it to make it read-only.
    *   **Goal:** The context is hardened by default. Any attempt to write to a hardened context struct will cause an immediate segmentation fault, preventing the attack.
    *   **Possible Roadblocks:** `mprotect` operates on page boundaries, not on individual structs. This requires careful memory management to ensure unrelated writable data is not on the same page, which might make the implementation complex.

## Medium Priority: Expansion & Optimization

*Once the foundation is solid, these tasks focus on adding major new capabilities, improving performance, and expanding test coverage.*

- [x] **Add `_Complex` Type Support**
    *   **Context:** The C `_Complex` type is a standard feature used in scientific and engineering domains. Supporting it is a key step towards feature-completeness. The ABI rules for `_Complex` are generally straightforward, often mapping directly to existing logic for two-element structs or Homogeneous Floating-point Aggregates (HFAs).
    *   **Idea:**
        1.  Introduce a new `INFIX_TYPE_COMPLEX` category to the `infix_type` system.
        2.  Add a new signature syntax, such as ~~`complex(f)` for `float _Complex` and `complex(d)` for `double _Complex`~~.
        3.  Update the ABI backends to classify this new type. On System V/AArch64, it should be treated like a two-element float/double aggregate. On Windows x64, it will be passed by reference (as its size, 16 bytes, is not a power of two).
    *   **Goal:** A user can create a trampoline for a function like `double _Complex cadd(double _Complex a, double _Complex b)` using the signature `"complex(d),complex(d)=>complex(d)"` and have it work correctly on all supported platforms.
    *   **Possible Roadblocks:** Minimal. The logic for this largely exists within the aggregate classifiers already. The main work is in plumbing the new type through the system.

- [x] **Internal Arena Allocator**
    *   **Context:** The JIT generation process involves many small, short-lived memory allocations which can be inefficient and cause fragmentation.
    *   **Idea:** Implement a simple arena/pool allocator for the lifetime of a single trampoline generation to reduce `malloc` overhead.
    *   **Goal:** This is an internal optimization. A benchmark must show a measurable speedup in the trampoline generation phase (the one-time setup cost). Trampoline generation is now ~50x faster for complex signatures.
    *   **Possible Roadblocks:** Requires careful changes to internal APIs to pass the allocator context around; potential for subtle memory management bugs during implementation.

- [x] **Profile Code Generation and Execution**
    *   **Context:** Before optimizing, we need to identify performance bottlenecks. We need to measure both the one-time cost of generating a trampoline and the per-call overhead of executing it.
    *   **Idea:** Use platform-specific profiling tools (Valgrind/Callgrind, Instruments, VTune) to measure trampoline generation and execution overhead.
    *   **Goal:** A new document, `docs/performance.md`, is created to summarize the findings and guide future optimization work.
    *   **Possible Roadblocks:** Profiling JIT'd code can be complex, as symbols may not be easily visible in standard profilers.

- [x] **Implement Packed Argument Trampolines**
    *   **Context:** The current `void** args` API requires pointer indirection. A "packed" API would improve cache performance by passing arguments in a single contiguous block of memory.
    *   **Idea:** Implement `infix_forward_create_packed`, where the JIT'd code reads arguments from offsets relative to a single pointer.
    *   **Goal:** A benchmark demonstrates a significant performance improvement for calls with many arguments compared to the standard trampoline.

- [x] **Implement Validation for Unresolved Types**
    *   **Context:** The JIT might try creating a trampoline if the signature contains an unresolved named reference (like `struct<Foo>`).

## Low Priority: Advanced Features & Polish

*These items are valuable but less critical. They can be addressed over time to round out the library's feature set.*

- [x] **Add SIMD Vector Type Support (Phased)**
    *   **Context:** High-performance computing, multimedia processing, and cryptography rely heavily on SIMD vector types (`__m128`, NEON types). Direct support for these types is a critical feature for advanced use cases.
    *   **Idea (Phased Approach):**
        1.  **Phase 1 (128-bit Vectors):** Add an `INFIX_TYPE_VECTOR` category and a signature syntax like `vector(f, 4)` for `__m128`. Update ABI backends to pass these types in XMM (x64) or VFP (AArch64) registers.
        2.  **Phase 2 (256/512-bit Vectors):** Extend the x64 backends to be aware of YMM and ZMM registers. Implement new emitters in `abi_x64_emitters.c` for AVX/AVX512 instructions and update classifiers for their unique passing rules.
    *   **Goal:**
        *   **Phase 1:** A user can successfully call a function taking `__m128d` on both SysV and Windows x64.
        *   **Phase 2:** A user can successfully call a function taking `__m256` on an AVX-capable system.
    *   **Possible Roadblocks:** Phase 2 is a major undertaking. It requires significant changes to the x64 register allocators and new, complex instruction encodings. Testing will require hardware or emulators that support AVX2 and AVX-512.

- [ ] **Implement RISC-V 64-bit ABI**
    *   **Context:** RISC-V is a growing open-source architecture. Adding support would demonstrate the library's portability.
    *   **Idea:** Create a new `abi_riscv.c` file and associated low-level instruction emitters, following the roadmap in `internals.md`.
    *   **Goal:** The library successfully compiles and passes the entire test suite on a RISC-V 64-bit platform (e.g., in QEMU within the CI).
    *   **Possible Roadblocks:** Access to RISC-V hardware or a reliable CI-based emulator is required for testing.

- [ ] **(Re-scoped: Should be done from the wrapper's language) Enhance `symbol_finder.pl` with Multi-Language Demangling**
    *   **Context:** The `symbol_finder.pl` script can be extended to demangle symbols from C++, Rust, and Fortran, making it a powerful tool for FFI development.
    *   **Idea:** Adopt a pragmatic, phased approach to implementation.
    *   **Goal:**
        *   **Phase 1:** The script shells out to standard toolchains (`c++filt` for Itanium) for immediate functionality.
        *   **Phase 2:** Begin the major task of writing pure-Perl demanglers from scratch for Itanium C++ and Rust v0 to remove all external tool dependencies.
    *   **Possible Roadblocks:** Writing full-featured demanglers from scratch (Phase 2) is an extremely large and complex undertaking.

- [ ] **Direct System Call Interface**
    *   **Context:** Some advanced applications need to bypass standard C libraries and make direct calls to the OS kernel, which uses a different, low-level ABI.
    *   **Idea:** Create a new `infix_syscall_create` API that emits assembly to load registers and execute the `syscall` instruction.
    *   **Goal:** A user can successfully call a basic OS syscall, such as `write` on Linux, using a generated trampoline.
    *   **Possible Roadblocks:** Extremely high implementation cost. Requires a unique ABI implementation for every supported OS. Testing is very difficult and OS-specific.

- [ ] **Add Exception Handling Boundary**
    *   **Context:** An unhandled C++ or SEH exception that crosses the FFI boundary will crash the program. A robust library should provide a way to handle this.
    *   **Idea:** Create a `infix_forward_create_safe` function where the JIT code wraps the native call in a `try...catch` or `__try...__except` block.
    *   **Goal:** If a native function throws an exception, the trampoline catches it, returns `INFIX_ERROR_NATIVE_EXCEPTION`, and the program does not crash.
    *   **Possible Roadblocks:** This requires mixing C and C++ or using platform-specific SEH, which adds significant complexity and potential portability issues.

- [ ] **Add Bitfield Support in Structs**
    *   **Context:** C allows structs to have bitfields, but their memory layout is highly compiler-specific. Supporting them is an advanced FFI feature.
    *   **Idea:** Extend the `infix_type` system to describe bitfields and implement the packing/unpacking logic for each ABI.
    *   **Goal:** Successfully call a function that takes a struct containing bitfields and get the correct result.
    *   **Possible Roadblocks:** This is a notoriously difficult part of FFI implementation, as bitfield layout rules are often poorly documented and vary even between versions of the same compiler.

- [ ] ~~**Add Type System Builder API**~~
    *   ~~**Context:** The current Manual API for creating complex structs is verbose and requires manual memory management for the member array within the arena.~~
    *   ~~**Idea:** Create a fluent builder pattern API (e.g., `infix_struct_builder_*` functions) to simplify type creation.~~
    *   ~~**Goal:** A user can define a complex struct without manually allocating or managing the `infix_struct_member` array, reducing boilerplate and potential for errors.~~
    * Supplanted by signature API.

- [ ] **Add Support for 32-bit Architectures**
    *   **Context:** A major future direction to support legacy or embedded systems.
    *   **Idea:** Create new ABI backends for 32-bit x86 and ARM.
    *   **Goal:** The library compiles and passes the test suite when targeting a 32-bit architecture.
    *   **Possible Roadblocks:** This is a very large undertaking, effectively doubling the number of supported ABIs that must be maintained and tested.

- [x] **Decouple Debug Logging from `double_tap.h`**
    *   **Context:** The library's internal `INFIX_DEBUG_PRINTF` macro should not be tied to the test framework's `note()` function, which improves modularity.
    *   **Idea:** Refactor `INFIX_DEBUG_PRINTF` in `utility.h` to use `fprintf(stderr, ...)` directly.
    *   **Goal:** The library source code (`src/`) has no includes of `double_tap.h`. Internal debug messages are printed to `stderr` when `INFIX_DEBUG_ENABLED` is active.
    *   **Possible Roadblocks:** Minimal; this is a straightforward refactoring task.

- [x] **Investigate and Fix Read-Only Context on macOS**
    *   **Context:** The read-only hardening for reverse trampoline contexts does not currently work on macOS due to platform-specific memory protection behavior.
    *   **Idea:** Research the correct combination of `mmap` flags and/or other system calls required to create a reliably read-only data page on macOS.
    *   **Goal:** The "Writing to a hardened reverse trampoline context causes a crash" test passes successfully on macOS.
    *   **Possible Roadblocks:** This may require deep knowledge of macOS virtual memory and could be more complex than on other POSIX systems.

- [x] **Add Half-Precision Floating-Point (`float16_t`) Support**
    *   **Context:** `_Float16` is increasingly important for machine learning and GPU-related tasks.
    *   **Idea:** Add a new primitive type. The ABI rules are simple: `_Float16` arguments are promoted to `float` and passed in standard floating-point registers.
    *   **Goal:** The library correctly handles `float16_t` arguments and return values.

- [ ] **Add Support for Scalable Vectors (ARM SVE & RISC-V 'V')**
    *   **Context:** This is the future of SIMD on these architectures, where the vector size is determined by the hardware at runtime.
    *   **Idea:** This would require a major architectural redesign. The JIT code would need to query the hardware's vector length at runtime and dynamically adjust its behavior.
    *   **Goal:** Basic support for a function taking a scalable vector type.
    *   **Possible Roadblocks:** Monumental implementation effort. Likely out of scope for the current library

- [x] **Typedef System**

## High Priority: Foundation & Stability

*These tasks focus on critical infrastructure, core reliability, and essential C language feature completeness. They must be addressed before major new features are added.*

- [x] **Complete the SEH "Safe" Boundary (Windows x64)**
    *   **Context:** The current `_infix_seh_personality_routine` in `executor.c` is a placeholder that still bubbles exceptions up. To truly support "safe" trampolines, it must perform a non-local goto to the trampoline's epilogue.
    *   **Idea:** Implement the redirect logic using `RtlUnwindEx` or by manually modifying `ContextRecord->Rip` to point to a landing pad/epilogue and returning `ExceptionContinueSearch` or `ExceptionContinueExecution` as appropriate to stop the search.
    *   **Goal:** `infix_forward_create_safe` can successfully catch a C++ or SEH exception in a called function and return a controlled `INFIX_CODE_NATIVE_EXCEPTION` error instead of crashing the process.

- [x] **Refine Registry Hash Table Growth in Arenas**
    *   **Context:** `_registry_rehash` currently "leaks" the old bucket array within the registry's arena when resizing. While arenas are freed as a unit, a long-lived registry that grows significantly can waste substantial memory.
    *   **Idea:** Switch the `buckets` array to use `infix_malloc`/`infix_realloc` instead of arena allocation, or implement an arena "checkpoint/rollback" mechanism to reclaim the old array if it was the most recent allocation.
    *   **Goal:** Memory usage for large, frequently-growing registries is optimized, preventing unnecessary memory pressure in long-running processes.

- [x] **Deepen Mangling Dialect Support (Itanium & MSVC)**
    *   **Context:** The current C++ mangling implementations are simplified and do not handle complex features like substitution (Itanium) or type back-references (MSVC).
    *   **Idea:**
        1.  **Itanium:** Implement the substitution dictionary (`S_`, `St`, etc.) to compress repeated types and namespaces.
        2.  **MSVC:** Implement type back-references (`0-9`) for previously encountered types in the signature.
    *   **Goal:** `infix_type_print` and `infix_function_print` produce mangled strings that exactly match those generated by standard C++ compilers, ensuring 100% compatibility with existing native libraries and linkers.

- [x] **Harden Instruction Cache Invalidation on ARM64**
    *   **Context:** `__builtin___clear_cache` may be insufficient or a no-op on some restrictive ARM64 Linux kernels or diverse hardware revisions.
    *   **Idea:** Add an explicit fallback to the `sys_icache_invalidate` syscall (syscall 259) or similar platform-specific mechanisms to ensure instruction cache consistency across all supported ARM64 environments.
    *   **Goal:** JITed code is 100% reliable on all ARM64 revisions, including those with unconventional cache hierarchies.

- [x] **Implement Trampoline Deduplication (Caching)**
    *   **Context:** Repeatedly creating trampolines for the same signature/target function pair wastes executable memory and JIT compilation time.
    *   **Idea:** Introduce a global or context-local cache (hash map) that stores created `infix_forward_t` handles keyed by a hash of their signature and target address. Use reference counting to manage shared handle lifetimes.
    *   **Goal:** Multiple calls to `infix_forward_create` with the same parameters return the same shared handle, significantly reducing memory overhead and initialization time in complex applications.

- [x] **Security: Hardened "Sanity Check" Marshalling**
    *   **Context:** The `direct_marshalling` API calls user-provided functions. A bug in a user's marshaller (e.g., misaligned stack, clobbered registers) can cause hard-to-debug crashes.
    *   **Idea:** Implement a "Sanity Mode" (enabled via build flag) where the JIT engine emits extra instructions before and after marshaller calls to verify stack pointer (`rsp`) balance and alignment.
    *   **Goal:** Developers can catch buggy marshaller implementations early during development via controlled assertions instead of chasing random segmentation faults in native code.
